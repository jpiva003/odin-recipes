        <h2>Description:<h2>
          <h4> With so many ways to enjoy fresh cherries, these cherry tarts are one of my favorites. They can be served warm or chilled, and we like them with a dollop of whipped cream and a sprinkleling of chocolate shavings.</h4>
          <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>1 (14.1) package refrigerated pie crusts</li>
            <li>1 pound fresh sweet cherried, pitted</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minute tapioca</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup whipped cream, or as needed (optional)</li>
            <li>grated chocolate as needed for granish (optional)</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Steps:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Place pie crusts on a lightly floured surface and roll out each crust with a rolling pin, so it is large enough to cut three 5 to 5-1/2-inch circles, for a total of 6 tart crusts </li>
            <li>Fit each dough circle into 4-inch removable bottom tart pan. Press the dough against the sides of the pans, and prick the bottom with a fork to prevent bubbling. Remove any excess dough by running the rolling pin across the top of each pan.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</li>  
            <li>In a large bowl, combine cherries, tapioca, sugar, almond extract, and salt. Remove the pans from the fridge and distribute cherry mixture evenly among the tart pans. Place the pans on a baking sheet.</li>   
            <li>Bake in the preheated overn until cherries are soft and crust is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>      
          </ol>
